Version 1.0.0 Sep. 12 2016

Version 1.1.0 Mar. 29 2018
Test environment:
1. NumPy 1.8.0 -> 1.14.0
2. Anaconda 4.1.1 -> 5.1.0
3. Prody 1.5.1 -> 1.9.4
4. SciPy 0.13.3 -> 1.19.0
Update:
1. Fixed run time error due to Prody upgrade: ANM.py line 2135, "if Mnormed == None" to "if Mnormed is None".
2. Fixed error due to Scipy upgrade: RMSDPrediction.py line 64, "float" to "int".
3. Fixed error due to Scipy upgrade: RMSDPrediction.py redefine phi array as 2D array.
4. Added conformational samples based on predicted RMSD and normal modes into Output file, see Manual for detail.
5. Several updates on Manual.

Version 1.1.1 Apr. 5 2018
Update:
1. Fixed bug on generating complex conformational samples due to package update.
2. Added Example4 for complex conformational samples by adding complex version in NMAUnified and also trained complex model.
3. Removeed false error/warning messages by updating ResultsPrinter.py.


Version 1.1.2 Mar. 28 2019
update:
1. Add complex sampling. (Sampling.py)
2. Add parameters of sampling inti 'Configuration.py' file
3. Remove the Example4.
